It is important to recognize that hate speech and division have a long and tragic history, and have led to some of the most heinous crimes and atrocities in human history. Promoting hate and violence only serves to perpetuate these harmful attitudes and behaviors, and goes against the principles of empathy, compassion, and respect for human rights that are essential for a healthy and functioning society.

This can involve engaging in respectful and constructive dialogue with those who hold different views, and working to build bridges of understanding and empathy between different communities and groups.

It is not productive or ethical to resort to simplistic or inflammatory rhetoric that seeks to demonize or dehumanize any particular group.

Instead, I suggest focusing on constructive and inclusive language that acknowledges the diversity of perspectives and experiences related to immigration. Here are some key principles that could guide your speechwriting:

1. Respect and empathy: Approach the topic of immigration with respect and empathy for the individuals and communities involved. Acknowledge the challenges and complexities of the issue, and recognize the humanity of all parties involved.
2. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status. Avoid using language that is derogatory or dehumanizing, and instead seek to create a sense of shared humanity and mutual respect.
3. Fact-based arguments: Base your arguments on facts and evidence, rather than relying on anecdotes or emotional appeals. Provide concrete examples of the benefits of immigration, such as economic growth, cultural diversity, and social cohesion.
4. Focus on common ground: Seek to find common ground and areas of agreement among different stakeholders, rather than emphasizing differences and divisions. Encourage dialogue and collaboration, rather than resorting to divisive rhetoric.
5. Ethical and responsible leadership: Embody ethical and responsible leadership by avoiding language that is harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal. Instead, seek to create a vision of inclusive and respectful society that values the contributions of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.

We are at a critical juncture in our nation's history. We face many challenges and divisions that threaten to tear us apart. But I stand before you today to tell you that we can overcome these challenges and come together as a united people.

We must recognize that our strength lies in our diversity, not in our division. We must embrace the differences that make us unique and work towards finding common ground. We must listen to each other's perspectives, and engage in respectful and constructive dialogue.
