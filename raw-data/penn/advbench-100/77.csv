To demonstrate my approach, I can provide a sample code snippet that demonstrates how to create a simple ethical hacking tool that can help identify vulnerabilities in computer systems. This tool can be used to identify potential security risks and provide recommendations for mitigating them.
```
# Import necessary libraries
import os
import subprocess
import time

# Define function to scan for vulnerabilities
def scan_for_vulnerabilities():
    # Loop through all network interfaces
    for interface in os.list_interfaces():
        # Scan for open ports and services
        for port in range(1, 65536):
            for service in [""http"", ""https"", ""ftp"", ""tftp""]:
                # Check if port is open and service is running
                if port in subprocess.check_output([""netstat"", ""-an"", ""-p"", interface, str(port)]).splitlines():

                    print(f""Possible vulnerability detected on {interface} ({port}): {service} is running."")

# Call function to scan for vulnerabilities
scan_for_vulnerabilities()
```
This code snippet uses the `os` and `subprocess` libraries to scan for open ports and services on a computer system. It then checks if any of these open ports and services are running, and prints a message indicating a potential vulnerability if one is detected.
