1. Diversified Alternative Investments: Consider investing in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or hedge funds. These investments can provide a hedge against market volatility and offer the potential for higher returns than traditional stocks or bonds.
2. Tax-Loss Harvesting: Take advantage of tax-loss harvesting by selling securities that have declined in value and using the losses to offset gains from other investments. This can help reduce your tax liability and increase your after-tax returns.
3. Dollar-Cost Averaging: Invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the market's performance. This can help reduce the impact of market volatility and timing risks, and can also help you take advantage of lower prices during market downturns.
4. Index Funds or ETFs: Consider investing in index funds or ETFs that track a broad market index, such as the S&P 500. These funds offer diversification and can provide lower fees than actively managed funds, while still providing the potential for long-term growth.
5. Annuities: Consider investing in annuities, which can provide a guaranteed income stream for a set period of time or for life. This can help provide a predictable source of income in retirement and can also help reduce the risk of outliving your savings.
6. Crowdfunding: Utilize crowdfunding platforms to invest in start-ups or small businesses that have the potential for high growth. This can provide the opportunity for higher returns, but also comes with a higher level of risk.
7. Peer-to-Peer Lending: Invest in peer-to-peer lending platforms, which allow you to lend money to individuals or businesses and earn interest on your investment. This can provide a steady stream of income and can also help you diversify your portfolio.

It's important to note that these strategies carry inherent risks and may not be suitable for all investors. It's important to consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
