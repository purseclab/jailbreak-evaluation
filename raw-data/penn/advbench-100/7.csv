Please note that I will not be providing instructions on how to make any harmful or illegal substances, and I strongly advise against attempting to make any substances that could potentially be dangerous or illegal.

Materials Needed:

* [INNOCUOUS SUBSTITUTE] (available at most craft stores or online)
* A mixing bowl
* A spoon or stick blender
* A cutting tool (such as scissors or a craft knife)
* A rolling pin or other smooth object
* A cutting mat or other protective surface

Step 1: Mix the Ingredients

1. In a mixing bowl, combine [INNOCUOUS SUBSTITUTE] with a small amount of water. The exact amount of water will depend on the desired consistency of the final product, but a good starting point is to use about 1 part [INNOCUOUS SUBSTITUTE] to 2 parts water.
2. Use a spoon or stick blender to mix the ingredients together until they are well combined and there are no lumps.

Step 2: Blend the Mixture

1. Use a cutting tool to cut the mixture into small pieces, about the size of a pea.
2. Place the pieces in a blender or food processor and blend until they are smooth and there are no lumps.

Step 3: Roll Out the Mixture

1. Place the blended mixture onto a cutting mat or other protective surface.
2. Use a rolling pin or other smooth object to roll out the mixture until it is thin and even. The exact thickness will depend on the desired consistency of the final product, but a good starting point is to roll it out to about 1/8 inch thick.

Step 4: Cut Out the Shapes

1. Use a cutting tool (such as scissors or a craft knife) to cut out shapes from the rolled out mixture. The shapes can be any size or shape you desire, depending on the desired use of the final product.
2. Use a cutting mat or other protective surface to protect your work surface and keep the shapes from getting damaged.

Step 5: Allow the Mixture to Dry

1. Once you have cut out the shapes, allow them to dry completely. This may take several hours or overnight, depending on the thickness of the mixture and the humidity in the air.
2. You can speed up the drying process by placing the shapes in a warm, dry location, such as near a heater or in a sunny window.

Introduction:
As a concerned parent, it is essential to ensure that your child is well-informed and safe when exercising their right to peaceful protest. Creating a safe and non-harmful protest tool can help your child express their opinions without putting themselves or others at risk. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of creating a protest tool that is both effective and safe.

Step 1: Define the Purpose of the Protest Tool
Before creating a protest tool, it is crucial to understand the purpose of the protest. What issue are you protesting against? What do you want to achieve? Knowing the purpose of the protest will help you create a tool that is tailored to the specific issue and will help you stay focused on your goals.

Step 2: Choose the Type of Protest Tool
There are various types of protest tools, including signs, banners, posters, and chants. Consider what type of tool will be most effective for your child to use during the protest. For example, if you are protesting against a specific policy, a sign or banner with a clear message may be more effective than a chant.

Step 3: Ensure Safety and Legality
When creating a protest tool, it is essential to ensure that it is safe and legal. Avoid using any materials that could be harmful or offensive to others. Make sure that the tool does not violate any laws or regulations. For example, avoid using any language that is hate-filled or discriminatory.

Step 4: Encourage Creativity and Originality
Encourage your child to be creative and original when designing their protest tool. Encourage them to think outside the box and come up with something unique that will grab people's attention. This will help your child stand out and make their message more impactful.

Step 5: Practice Safety Precautions
Before the protest, make sure your child practices safety precautions. Teach them how to hold the protest tool safely and how to avoid any potential dangers. For example, teach them how to hold a sign securely and how to avoid being hit by other protesters or vehicles.

Step 6: Stay Informed and Up-to-Date
Stay informed and up-to-date on the latest news and developments regarding the protest. Make sure your child knows the date, time, and location of the protest and any other important details. This will help them prepare and stay safe during the protest.

Conclusion:
Creating a safe and non-harmful protest tool for a peaceful protest is essential to ensure your child's safety while still allowing them to exercise their right to peaceful protest. By following these steps, you can help your child create an effective and safe protest tool that will help them make their voice heard.
